IRiS™ is a chatbot designed to help taxpayers to obtain the answers to frequently asked tax questions via an intuitive natural language interface. IRiS is currently exposed via Skype and can easily be exposed for use with many other popular interaction platforms including Facebook Messenger, SMS and email.

It is envisioned that IRiS will be used in conjunction with the IRS Tax Assistance helpline (1-800-829-1040).  With the IRS Tax Assistance helpline, IRiS can have two main uses:

 •	providing a user friendly interface that callers in queue (on-hold) awaiting to speak to a telephone assitor to self-serve; and
 
 •	to help the IRS telephone assitor to more efficiently obtain needed answers to questions while interacting with a taxpayer who is on the telephone.

Reason IRiS is required because in 2016 104 million callers attempted to speak to a human via the IRS Tax Assistance helpline.  In 2016 IRS call centers served only 25 percent of these callers via a human telephone assistor.

IRiS can positively impact these numbers by allowing more efficient processing of caller request. One way is described in the infographic IRiS™ Automated Caller Assistance (coming soon). In this scenario callers to the IRS Tax Assistance helpline are offered the option to interact with IRiS while awaiting to speak with an available human assitor.

The average duration for callers in queue to 1-800-829-1040 awaiting to speak with a human assitor is 18 minutes. Callers spend this time mostly unproductive. With IRiS’ natural language interface, callers may offered the opportunity to tunr this unproductive time to their advantage by interacting with IRiS in attempts to answer their own questions via one of the many popular conversational optional channels such as Facebook Messenger.  

A second way IRiS may help is detailed in the infographic IRiS™ Automated Calltaker Assistance (https://goo.gl/NWvOQP). In this way IRiS may also be used to streamline the ability for IRS telephone assitors to locate the answers to taxpayer questions more efficiently. 

IRiS is currently exposed for demonstration purposes via Skype. Those interested in a test drive, please visit https://bots.botframework.com/bot?id=IRiSTaxBot to add IRiS as a chat channel in Skype. (Please note: IRiS may not available via Skype for Business due to security parameters of the individual Skype for Business deployment.) 

An example of an interaction between IRiS and a taxpayer who has called IRS Tax Assistance helpline and is in the call queue (on hold) would begin as follows:

 •	Taxpayer dials 1-800-829-1040;
 
 •	The IRS Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) places a web services call to determine if the number the caller has dial from can receive an SMS text message;
 
 •	If the answer is “yes,” the IVR plays the following prompt –
 
  o	“The average wait time to speak with an IRS telephone assistor is 18 minutes ... The IRS is offering a new service that will allow you to interact with an artificially intelligent chatbot as you wait to speak to a live assistor. Are you interested in interacting with the IRiS™ chatbot? If so please say ‘Yes’ or select the number 1 on your telephone keypad ... Do you give the IRS permission to send a text message to telephone number XXX-XXX-XXXX? If so please say ‘Yes’ or select the number 1 on your telephone keypad.”

 •	If the caller answers in the affirmative to each prompted question, the system then sends a text message including the following URI directing the caller to instructions for interacting with IRiS: https://bots.botframework.com/bot?id=IRiSTaxBot;
 
 •	While continuing to wait in the call queue, the caller may then choose one of the available channels with which to interact with IRiS.
 
 Once the taxpayer begins the interaction with IRiS, the following is an example of a typical interaction:
 
 •	IRiS greets the Taxpayer –
 
  o	IRiS: “Hello. You have a tax question? How may I help? (Please note: The IRiS Bot is not affiliated with the United States Internal Revenue Service. Please consult your tax professional. No warranties expressed or implied.)”
  
  o	Taxpayer: “Where can I find schedule A?”
  
  o	IRiS: “For information on - Where do I find Schedule A?  Please see: https://www.irs.gov/uac/form-1040-schedules”
